# Smart Agricultural Irrigation Management System

## Overview

The objective is to develop an IoT-based intelligent irrigation management system to optimize water usage in agricultural practices. By leveraging real-time weather data and soil moisture information, the system aims to enhance water conservation, reduce wastage, and improve crop health.

## Functional Requirements

### Data Collection

- Continuously monitor soil moisture levels using in-field sensors.
- Fetch real-time weather data, with an emphasis on precipitation forecasts, from a reliable weather data source.

### Data Processing and Decision Making

- Analyze the collected soil moisture data against predefined moisture thresholds suitable for various crops.
- Utilize weather forecast data to adjust irrigation plans, especially focusing on predicted rainfall to avoid unnecessary irrigation.
- Implement a decision algorithm to automatically determine the irrigation needs based on current soil moisture levels and weather predictions.

### Irrigation Control

- Automate irrigation valves using actuators based on the system's decisions to ensure optimal irrigation.
- Allow for manual control and intervention in the irrigation process through a user interface.

### User Interface

- Provide a user-friendly dashboard that displays current soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and irrigation schedules.
- Enable users to manually adjust irrigation parameters and schedules through the dashboard interface.

### Notifications and Alerts

- Generate alerts for critical situations such as low soil moisture levels or system faults.
- Offer recommendations for irrigation based on comprehensive data analysis.

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware

- Utilize a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) as the central control unit.
- Employ soil moisture sensors and actuators for controlling irrigation mechanisms.

### Backend

- Take a look to [backend specifications](./backend/README)

### Frontend

- Take a look to [frontend specifications](./backend/README)

### Database

- Implement a database solution for storing historical data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and irrigation actions. This data will support trend analysis and decision-making process enhancements.

### Connectivity and Integration

- Ensure secure and reliable communication between the IoT devices, the backend system, and the user interface.
- Design the system to be modular, allowing easy integration with additional sensors, actuators, or data sources in the future.

### Security

- Apply industry-standard security measures to protect data transmission and access to the system dashboard.

## Implementation Plan

### Prototype Development

- Start with developing a prototype that focuses on integrating the hardware components and basic data collection.

### System Development

- Proceed with the backend logic development alongside the frontend dashboard, ensuring both components communicate effectively.

### Integration and Testing

- Perform comprehensive testing to ensure hardware and software components work seamlessly together and the system operates as intended.

### Deployment and Field Testing

- Deploy the system in a controlled agricultural setting for initial testing, gather feedback for refinement.

### Scaling and Enhancement

- Based on initial feedback and system performance, refine and potentially scale the system for broader application. Consider additional functionalities or integration capabilities with other agricultural technologies.

This project proposal outlines an agnostic approach to developing a smart irrigation management system, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and user-centric design to meet the evolving needs of modern agriculture and sustainable water management practices.
